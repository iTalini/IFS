Interactive Fireplace System

Objective:

Create an interactive fireplace system where the player can start a fire, add fuel, and watch the fire intensity change over time.

Requirements:

1. The First Person is template as the starting point.
2. A fireplace actor with a particle system for the fire effect.
3. When the player approaches the fireplace and presses E, the fire starts (if itâ€™s not already burning).
4. The fire intensity decrease over time (e.g., reduce the scale or opacity of the fire particle system).
5. When the player presses F, the fuel is replenished to 100%, and the fire intensity resets to maximum.
6. Displays the current fuel level on the screen using a simple UI widget (e.g., a progress bar or text).

Deliverables:
- The fireplace system is fully functional and interactive.
- Includes a test level with the fireplace actor and instructions on how to interact with it.
